# DATA3320 - Project 2: Education Inequality in the U.S.

## Description:

This project addresses educational inequality in U.S. high schools by focusing on students' performance on college entrance exams like the ACT and SAT.

## Data:

The primary data set is from EdGap and the secondary data set is from the National Center for Education Statistics.

The NCES data source can be found at: https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/pubschuniv.asp

Since the NCES data is too large for Github, it can be accessed from the drive link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HvW2w-o2XZzCm4KTvnb1Bb3BvoAa14BP/view?usp=sharing

1. Inspect data set
2. Convert data types where necessary
3. Dropped unnecessary columns
4. Join the EdGap and NCES sets
